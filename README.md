# Static Comp Challenge!
We were tasked with re-creating a webpage based off a provided static comp. I am passionate about plant based cooking, so I decided to put my own spin on things and creating a "recipe" website with different cards of meal ideas. All of the images were provided by [UNSPLASH](https://unsplash.com/) which is a free source of images provided by various creators.

I also made this site responsive for mobile, tablets and large screens.
